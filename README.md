# AD-L-JEPA-Release

Source code repo for [AD-L-JEPA: Self-Supervised Spatial World Models with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Autonomous Driving with LiDAR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04969), the first joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) based method for self-supervised representation learning of autonomous driving scenarios with LiDAR data.

We'll release the source code, pretrained models (both self-supervised and supervised, except for models with the Waymo dataset due to Waymo's licensing constraints), and training logs by the end of January 2025. Please stay tuned for more updates!
